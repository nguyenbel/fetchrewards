    "### Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Data Analyst\n",
    "In this exercise you will:\n",
    "* Demonstrate how you reason about data and how you communicate your understanding of a specific data set to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the requirements?\n",
    "* Review unstructured JSON data and diagram a new structured relational data model\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Third: Evaluate Data Quality Issues in the Data Provided\n",
    "Using the programming language of your choice (SQL, Python, R, Bash, etc...) identify **at least one data quality issue.** We are not expecting a full blown review of all the data provided, but instead **want to know how you explore and evaluate data of questionable provenance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Commit your code and findings to the git repository along with the rest of the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fourth: Communicate with Stakeholders\n",
    "**Construct an email or slack message that is understandable to a product or business leader who isn’t familiar with your day to day work.** This part of the exercise should **show off how you communicate and reason about data with others.** Commit your answers to the git repository along with the rest of your exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What questions do you have about the data?\n",
    "* How did you discover the data quality issues?\n",
    "* What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?\n",
    "* What other information would you need to help you optimize the data assets you're trying to create?\n",
    "* What performance and scaling concerns do you anticipate in production and how do you plan to address them?\n",

I did prior research that is now deleted to see if any of the *brands* '\\_id' column values equaled the *receipts* '\\_id' column values, but it didnt' seem like any were equal, so we wouldn't be able to join on that for the *brands* and *receipts* tables.\n",

However, from the first 5 and last 5 rows of *receipts*, the brandCode is 'None,' so if I had more time, I'd take a deeper look into the different values for this column. Since it translates to a dictionary when you use Pandas, I'd probably create an empty list, iterate through the column length, append the unique brandCodes (but this is a very rough pseudocode, so I'm probably missing some steps).\n",
